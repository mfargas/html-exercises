    <p> The legendary Matt Groening is an American cartoonist who created the Simpsons
      among many other adult cartoons. Groening revolutionized the adult cartoon genre
      and created iconic characters that have legacies like no other.</p>

    <p> You may recognize his creations ranging from Netflix original <em> Disenchantment </em>
      to his most famous line of work <em> The Simpsons </em>. My <em> personal</em> favorite would be
      <em> Futurama</em> however I believe it is drastically underrated and in <em> The Simpsons's </em>
      shadow.
